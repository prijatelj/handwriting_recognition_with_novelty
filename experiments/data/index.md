## Data

All dataset specific code resides here, such as data loaders and preprocessing.
Actual data is intended to be allowed to reside anywhere the user desires, and the code here is meant to load for the user specified source.
For example, the user may specify a CSV or other file that indicates the paths to the different parts of the datasets, such as root directory of the dataset, the individual sample files, etc.
