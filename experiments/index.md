## Experiments

Examples and reproducible experiments are located here for performing research.
The scripts here use the package(s) provided in this repo and depict their use.

### Future Warning

In the future, experiments may be moved to inside the package by default and a flag added to setup.py to allow optional installation of the experiments package.
As it is setup now, two packages are needed to be installed: the repo's actual package(s) and the experiments package.
